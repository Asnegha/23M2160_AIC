Little did we all expect that an AI tool like ChatGPT would become our multi-tasking helper. This tremendous development in the field of AI has captivated me. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to and grow with the vibrant AI community in Bombay. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on a few projects in the deep learning domain. My BTech project explored a novel strategy to address small object and class imbalance problems in object detection. For this project, I used the mmdetection toolbox based on PyTorch and worked with the COCO dataset. 

Currently pursuing my master's degree, I have gained valuable experience in conducting research, from literature reviews to experimental design through my seminar and R&D activities. Through AIC, I want to contribute to projects which impact a wider audience. Want to build and be part of an encouraging community environment. Not just limited to short-term hackathons, willing to be part of long-term projects which impact the IIT Bombay student community as a whole.
Joining the AIC represents an invaluable opportunity for me to contribute to and benefit from a network of like-minded individuals dedicated to advancing AI.
